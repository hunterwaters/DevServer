API: 
Summary: This API has a number of protected endpoints with authentication and verification using web tokens. The API connects to a MongoDB database and stores profiles, users, and login credentials to the database. Using the MongoDB models, the API uses the users login credentials in order to retrieve their individual profile information and allows them to edit, delete, and add information to their profile on the application. Also, the API targets other users under the profile section of the application allowing other developers to communicate with one another and review their profiles and skills as well. The API also allows for a new user to login and make a profile from scratch.



Description: This application is a social platform for developers. A user can register and build a profile with education and experience fields and connect with other developers. This app also allows the logged in user to have him/her github repos attatched to their profile for other developers to view. There is also a section to like, unlike, and comment on other developers post. Enjoy!!
